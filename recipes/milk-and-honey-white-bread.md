# TITLE
Yield: ~4 large loaves


## ingredients
* 3 cups warm water
* 3 cups warm milk
* 3 oz honey
* 2 3/4 T yeast
* 3 T salt
* 3/4 cups melted butter
* 12-16 cups bread flour
* (1 egg for eggwash)

## steps  
1. Mix together warm water, milk, honey.  Dissolve yeast into mixture and let sit until foamy.
2. Combine yeast mixture with half of bread flour, melted butter, and salt.  If using stand mixer, use dough hook to knead, adding 1 cup of flour at a time until dough pulls away from sides of mixer.  If kneading by hand, follow same process, but start with more of than half of flour in base doughball to have an easier time kneading on countertop.
3. Once dough passes window-pane or poke test, allow to rise until doubled in volume (1-2 hours).
4. Punch down and shape dough into loaves, brush with eggwash, and let rise until poke test shows no spring-back (20-30 min).
5. Bake at 375F until internal temp reads 180F or higher (35-45 min).

## notes  
* Oven temperature 375 F
